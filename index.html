		<date>May 27 2023</date>

		<p>I get that most of you are here probably for quality tech/infosec content. But this is my personal blog, so I was going to have to, at some point, commentate on how screwed we all are with a timestamped git commit. Not that the world's governments have not had enough "I told you so" climate milestones.</p>

		<p>I will make this as relevant as possible to this target audience. Look away now if you don't want to read on. You will most likely hate me after reading this article if you don't agree with it. That's okay, I won't mind. Here, I'll add a <a href="javascript:toggle_hide('climate-grief-hidable')">hide</a> toggle just for you.</p>

	<div id=climate-grief-hidable>
		<p>To start, I would like to say that for the majority of the readers who are just doing their jobs, and your jobs involve creating/maintaining/securing computer software, this is NOT YOUR FAULT. How much you reuse, reduce, recycle as an individual do not make a massive difference in the grand scheme of things. Your contribution to the climate crisis is a droplet in an ocean.</p>

		<p>Don't get me wrong. Doing your part is great and important. But individual responsibility is the lie governments lobbied by corporate greed want us to believe. So don't save on electricity just to freeze to death in winter. It's not your fault.</p>

		<p>To quote <a target=_blank href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705155001/https://locusmag.com/2022/07/cory-doctorow-the-swerve/>Cory Doctorow, we’re all trapped on a bus</a>. The bus is barreling towards a cliff. Beyond the cliff is a canyon plunge any of us will be lucky to survive. It's time to swerve. It's almost past the time to swerve - the swerve is a happy ending.</p>

		<p>"Nonsense," they say. "Long before we go over the cliff, we’ll have figured out how to put wings on this bus." - that's the attitude of Silicon Valley tech bros, many of which we work for directly or indirectly as a technology supplier. The time has passed for Venture Capital investments into "Green Tech", Carbon Capture and Tesla tablets on wheels. No amount of tech can save us from the oncoming onslaught. Besides, it's all being pumped into AI and ChatGPT anyway.</p>

		<p>Innovation, Growth and Scale are the words we live by in this industry. Like an image in <a href=https://katecrawford.net/ target=_blank>Kate Crawford's Atlas of AI</a>, we love growing and profiting at scale. Evangelized by the magical words of "growth hackers", we find ways to funnel the most amount of users onto our platforms as we can. We A/B test the UX to make it perfectly addicting. Software and drugs are the only industries who call clients "users". </p>

		<p>Let's zoom out from software real quick, and realize that the stuff we make run on servers in the "cloud", and that the cloud made up of metal boxes (sorry, computers) made with rare metals, and plugged into thousands of UPSs made with lots of lithium (which we don't have enough of to move the entire world to EVs, btw), and that all of the comfortable lives we have  sitting in our nice home offices running code on "infinitely scalable" cloud resources are made possible because of an extraction based economy. We dig, cut, and burn Earth's natural resources without limits, export labour to third world countries and do all of this to scale up. Then when we are done with our old stuff we throw them away and recycle up to a minuscule percentage of materials.</p>

		<img src=images/atlas-of-ai.png width="40%" alt="a giant screw going down from server farms, to upper class labour workers, to the environment, down to underground miners extracting from the Earth">

		<p>Behind every git pull and push is an impressive feat of engineering, cooperation and human ingenuity that depends on a supply chain that run as long and wide as the entire planet Earth. Behind the modern comforts we have are stories of limits, resources both natural and human, that depends on the biological ecosystem's ability to sustain itself. Those systems are failing, planet wide.</p>

		<p>To be clear, the computer industry even with all of its server farms running in the middle of the desert does not use most of the energy in the world; nor do we produce most emissions. Computers are not nearly the hungry beasts that are our cars, ships and politicians. Collectively computers take up about less than 15% of energy use. But computers are the "brains" that now power the logistics, algorithms and infrastructure of almost every single part of our Business-As-Usual society. And acting this BAU when we are in a bus speeding towards a cliff is what will kill us.</p>

		<p>Now is not the time for business-as-usual-slightly-accelerated development of sustainable energy. Now is the time for us to take in the fact that no matter how hard we try to innovate and put wings on the bus, flying will not save us. The Terra Firma on which life is sustained is going to be severely fucked up to the point of no return. It's an extinction level event. We are all in this together.</p>

		<p>Except we're not. We are "safeguarding our own national interests"; we are digging our own bunkers, building our own escape Earth rockets and trying to upload our own brains to the cloud. That's describing the rich among us who can, of course. The rest of us are just drowning in rising sea levels and crippling in inflation and debt. Did I mention that everyone will starve?</p>

		<p>Sheltered behind civilized and adult-looking corporate headquarters and parliament buildings, the developed world collectively acts like a bunch of tribal kids busy squabbling each other for who should get most fish from the bullied kids in the poorer villages. Worse, we look like a bunch of tribal kids who are oblivious to the fact that in a generation or so we won't have any fish left. There is no unity. There is a giant internet that connects to almost everyone in the world; but we use it mostly for mining data out of doom-scrolling social media users to sell them ads, and spam.</p>

		<p>That's climate grief. It's the recognition and internal processing that as a species we are not capable of swerving a bus that's hurtling towards a cliff. It's the feeling of powerlessness, because "doing your part" is not going to be enough. </p>

		<p>I sincerely hope I am wrong. Maybe we can put wings on the bus. But I doubt it.</p>

		<p>As sentient human beings, we are all agents of change. We are capable of changing ourselves, others around us, and the environment we live in. What we are facing is a very, very hard problem that we have ran out of time to solve well. </p>

		<p>When I was presented with this information, and did research to verify it, the question was "what do I do with this information?". You might be asking the same, and I have not figured it out yet. </p>

		<p>I am still grieving.</p>

		<h3 id=ip-dns-phone-numbers-shaped-internet-security-and-freedom><a href=#ip-dns-phone-numbers-shaped-internet-security-and-freedom>DNS, IP, phone numbers and how they shaped internet security and freedom</a></h3>

		<date>May 2023</date>

		<p>There was a time before DNS (Domain Name System, the thing that lets you type <code>google.com</code> into your browser bar and get the website to load). DNS was introduced because there was a lot of IP (v4) addresses to remember; DNS is a fragile and insecure system. Now it's the backbone of the internet. It's impossible to do much without DNS. </p>
		<p>Or is it? The Internal Protocol (IP) was born long after telecommunication. Remember phone numbers? That's right, we still use them! There are some fundamental differences between telephones and IP that I believe have shaped the internet and business model of internet companies today:
		<ol>
		<li><strong>anyone can reach a phone number; not anyone can reach an IP address</strong> because of NAT (Network Address Translation) due to the way that TCP/UDP ports are not forwarded.</li>
		<li><strong>anyone can register for a static number</strong> (ever heard of a dynamic phone number? that would be <strong>so dumb</strong>!); it's really hard to get a static IP address. But just imagine if your phone number changed at random times, and there has to be this weird, decentralised system to keep every one of your friends updated about it (yep, that's DNS)</li>
		<li><strong>phone numbers are not attached to a globally public name</strong> (sure, you can put it on an advertisement, business card or poster; but what the other person saves your number as on their contact list is entirely up to them)</p></li>
	</ol>


		<p>Let's first discuss point one. The fact that not everyone can reach something behind an IP lead to the boom of online hosting and cloud services. One could easily setup a home phone, and even an answering machine, to receive calls; but if you want to host a website at home, good luck. You will need to see if your ISP (internet service provider) has given you a static or dynamic IP address (usually it's dynamic); you will need to forward a port from your network to the ISP; you will need to buy a domain name, and setup HTTPS certificates. The whole thing is really complicated to someone who hasn't done it before, and a lot of the time you would just want to get a hosting provider to do it for you. </p>
		<p>The initial scene of web hosting later lead to the cloud as we know it today, as well as the fact that now to talk to people online we use third-party platforms like Meta, Twitter and crap like that. Those internet giants earn money by mining your data and giving you ads. Why is it so hard now to talk to someone online without a third party?</p>
		<p>Now point two. Imagine if your phone number changed at random intervals, because the world has ran out of phone numbers. How dumb would that be! Having dynamic IPs on the internet further lead to the widespread use of DNS. With something like a Dynamic DNS service, you can update the DNS record to match your real IP uscraping an automatic update agent. But if that breaks, or if you don't have a domain name, then you're screwed. Of course, this only applies if you're the person hosting the server/website; if you're just visiting, that won't really break anything, except the fact that IP addresses are much harder to attribute to the end party when you are reading the web server logs. If you're just answer your phone, you have an idea who your friends calling you are and what their number is without having them to "login" to you, because usually one person has one unchanging phone number.</p>
		<p>Point three relates a lot to security, phishing and spam. Let's suppose you have small business with a domain <code>bobthebaker.com</code> (purely fictional), to let users login to your site and order bread. All of a sudden, anyone could try to pretend to be you by registering similar domains like <code>bobbakes.com</code>, <code>bobthebakre.com</code>, <code>bobsbakery.com</code>, <code>bobthebaker.net</code> and so on. In a <strong>globally public</strong> namespace, anyone can register any domain. It becomes a competition. If you forgot to renew, someone could squat your domain and sell it to you for more. Have you ever been scared that someone else would try to register a very lookalike phone number to you and call your friends to scam them? Not exactly, right? </p>
		<p>The concept of the phone book to have a verified two-way trust (if alice is calling bob, bob knows it's alice) doesn't exist on the internet world. If someone visits your website, it could be from anywhere. There is a disconnect between someone's login session (after they punch in a password that might have been compromised, with multi factor authentication that might've been bypassed using phishing), and their actual visiting origin (IP address because that's dynamic). And you can't really contact someone if they reach out to your server and does something dodgy without them manually providing you information that could be faked during signup.</p>

		<h4><u>Security in the dialup age</u></h4>
		<p>We did use to have phones sitting in front of computers, running dialup systems. Back then, because there was no NAT or firewalls, all those servers were reachable via phone lines, and you could "war-dial" - call up a huge range of numbers and record responses to see what was behind the number. This was not exactly a flaw of the phone system, but rather its intended purpose. People just weren't security conscious, and did not put things like authentication or allowlisting in front of these dialup systems.</p>
		<p>Now, reconnaissance is done by enumerating DNS domains and sub-domains, as well as scanning massive ranges of IP address. Not that different from war-dialing, except because of how easy it is to use proxies, VPNs and cloud servers without offering your identity at all (unlike phone number registrations), you can do that easily without being traced. (Of course, many tricks existed back then to use relays/switches/other phone systems as a proxy)</p>


		<h4><u>The constant third party risk</u></h4>
		<p>Because so much of what we do on the internet now relies on third party hosting and platforms, there's always third party risk. All that signup is not only done once with your phone company, but 50 different SaaS platforms holding your PII; your data is now in 50 different places, with no centralized security. You don't know if/when your data was stolen. Even if you are a business, those rules still apply. I understand that's not an inherent problem introduced by the way IPv4 has turned out, but rather the way businesses operate; but from a personal user perspective, not being able to reach someone else on the internet without either 1) self hosting some server with a third party provider or 2) using a third party platform is rather ridiculous. Everything is connected, and yet, everything is behind a wall of mistrust.</p>


		<h4><u>A way back?</u></h4>
		<p>Putting control of data back in the user's hands starts not with enforced controls for third parties, but <strong>changing the model entirely so that people can talk to other people online without a third party</strong>. A way back to a system much like phone numbers, with at least these properties:
		- anyone can register an identifier
		- the identifer is not tied to a public/global name (to prevent lookalikes, also because there are lots of people with the same name in the world)
		- the identifier is static and public (treated as itself, not behind a naming system like DNS)
		- systems behind the identifier can be reached (no NAT / anything like that), unless specified
		- the identifier is not too long, and easy to remember (for example, IPv6 is too long to remember; but an address / contact book could solve this issue)
		- it can work over the internet (like an overlay network?), or existing infrastructure (like telephones)</p>
		<p>Yes, it looks like "yet another third party platform"; perhaps a more elegant solution is we finally roll out IPv6 for good to eliminate NAT, and use a DNS system that assigns easily memorable names using the hash of the IP address (like <a href="https://github.com/h4sh5/humandns">humandns</a>, which you can see in action here to get a domain name for your IPv6 address when you visit <a href=http://ns1.humandns.org/rego>http://ns1.humandns.org/rego</a>.</p>
		<p>If internet access (seeing others on the internet) is basically a human right, so should the ability to host servers and sites (making oneself be seen on the internet). The current client-&gt;server model gives too much power to service providers and internet giants; everyone should just be able to talk to each other and visit one another virtually, like how the phone system works.</p>

		<h3 id=tips-for-problem-solving><a href=#tips-for-problem-solving>Tips for problem solving</a></h3>

		<date>Some time in 2023</date>

		<p>Problem solving is all about the attitude. For me, I find that the best attitude that works for solving any problem (no matter how urgent/important it is) is <strong>steadfastness</strong>. Being calm, collected, no matter the amount of raging hormones and emotions rushing through your system (such as in the case of a critical incident or very emotional event), and knowing that you can do it, or at least can make a dent in it. Take it one step at a time.</p>
		<p>The most important thing to remember is confidence. Go into a problem thinking that you have what it takes to at least <em>do something about it</em>. Not everything is achievable by you, and many things not achievable by you alone; but if you punch a wall hard enough long enough eventually you will at least leave some sort of mark. It's okay to not be able to make a giant breakthrough. Just stay calm and keep trying until you are too tired.</p>
		<p>The first thing to do is breathe. Don't ever forget to breathe. Slow down your pace, stop panicking if you are, orient yourself.</p>
		<p>Then, decide whether or not this is a problem / task that needs some careful planning. If it does, take out your favorite planning tool, be that a blank piece of paper, your notebook, a text editor, tablet, or just an app on your phone. Maybe you like a bunch of sticky notes. The point is to have your most comfortable tool to dump out all your thoughts in a semi-organized way. Don't focus too much on formality - just take note of everything you think of, and your process.</p>
		<p>If there are many things to try and experiment with, make sure the attempts are logged each with its result. Kind of like a science experiment. Record all your inputs and outputs. A spreadsheet could be really good for this. Make sure you save things along the way, take photos of paper copies, make copies to the cloud, etc. When something works, make sure you never lose that so you can reproduce it later. This goes for pentests, log searching queries ran during incident response, home renovation, science experiments, fixing code, self help and literally anything else that's trial-and-error.</p>
		<p>Don't be afraid to ask for help (obviously, duckduckgo it and do your own homework first). When asking others for help, make sure you include what you have tried and describe the problem as specifically as you can so to not waste their time. For asking technical/programming questions the smart way, there's a <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">good article by esr</a> for hackers.</p>
		<p>That's generally the way I approach problems. I have done a lot of CTF challenges, responded to lots of incidents, hacked a lot of things and debugged a lot of outright disgusting code. It mostly works. And when it doesn't, that steadfastness allows me to say that I have tried hard enough, made a dent, learned something, and it's okay to fail.</p>

	<h3 id=dependable-dependecies><a href=#dependable-dependecies>On dependable dependency systems</a></h3>

	<date>April 2023</date>

	<p>To have a dependable dependency/packaging/third party libaries system, you need at least these things:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>versioning</li>
	<li>a parseable file that has all (including recursive) dependencies, versions and how they relate to each other</li>
	<li>a way to easily verify where the code of the dependency comes from (and who wrote it)</li>
	<li>a way to verify that it hasn't been tampered with (checksums)</li>
	<li>a way to reproduce builds that can be verified</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Let's start with Python's pip. Pip (pypi) does not have lockfiles; <code>requirements.txt</code> does not come with recursive dependencies and there are no checksums to verify anything. Pypi's "link to github" or other links project version control/websites are self-published by the author, separate to the actual versions of the published packages. To make things worse, typosquatted packages can have the same link to git and the official project websites, have the same descriptions, but actual malware when you run pip install. Pip does not have any kind of 'reproducible builds' for wheels and eggs either. That's why when using pip, using virtual environments (<code>virtualenv</code>, <code>python -m venv</code>) is almost a must; otherwise, use more modern dependency management systems like <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>poetry</a>.</p>

	<p>What about javascript's npm? The situation looks a bit better. There are lockfiles alongside dependency description files, <code>package.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code>, and package-lock.json does contain checksums for verification. The package-lock.json file can be parsed to generate an SBOM (Software bill of materials), since it includes recursive dependencies and versions of every package that needs to be pulled in. However, npm packages are still self-published; there is no verifiable link between the name of the package (which is what really gets installed and executed) and source code control (like git). A very similar situation exists for Ruby's <code>Gemfile</code> and <code>Gemfile.lock</code>, as well as Rust's Cargo.</p>

	<p>Java is a mess. For Maven, lockfiles do not exist, and there is currently no way to generate lists of all dependencies without external tools like <code>spdx-sbom-generator</code>. Same goes for Gradle, which needs something like <code>cyclonedx-gradle-plugin</code>. Most gradle projects are also distributed with a wrapper script for gradle itself, <code>gradlew[.bat]</code>. God knows if that's been modified.</p>

	<p>The problem here is centralized package repositories/registries. They need hosting, management, which means they often belong to big corporations; and they are usually ripe with malware. They are a giant target for both cyber criminals and greedy corporations; the left-pad and kik incident where npm forcibly transferred the ownership of a package name from an open-source developer to a messaging app company shows that legal action on centralized repositories can all of the sudden break half the web.</p>

	<p>The good example I want to mention here is Golang. In golang, you directly reference a URL-like format (github.com/username/repo) for the dependency, and its version is in <code>go.mod</code> and checksums in <code>go.sum</code>. This directly ties the source code repository with the package and the account that wrote it. <a target=_blank href=https://hackernoon.com/building-reproducible-verifiable-binaries-with-golang>Reproducible builds are possible</a> if the same version of go is used, with <code>-trimpath</code> to remove the build path and <code>-ldflags=-buildid=</code> to stop the buildid from changing.</p>

	<p>The software landscape moves too fast and is too dangerous for bad dependency systems; dependency hell is everywhere, but it doesn't have to be. With dependency systems that support lockfiles, checksums and reprodicible builds, your code projects will be more secure and more maintainable.</p>

	<h3 id=on-ctrl-f><a href=#on-ctrl-f>On control-F</a></h3>

	<date>Some time in 2023</date>

	<p>I am often surprised by the number of people who don't intuitively use Ctrl+F when browsing the web. In many browsers, where "Highlight All" is something you can do when doing Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F if you're on mac), you can do some very useful ad-hoc thematic analysis of articles.</p>

	<p>For example, if you're reading an article on a review of a certain social media platform but there's no mention of the word "ads" or "advertisement", that could be an intentional omission, or something the author forgot to mention; if it's an article about the COVID pandemic and how vaccines are bad for your kids but there's no single mention of the word "study" or "studies", then where are they getting the proof from?</p>

	<p>If the website you are using is too cluttered (or have too many irrelevant annoying things like ads), then use reader mode by doing Ctrl+Alt+R on Linux/Windows to toggle to a much easier to view interface with consistent fonts. Most websites that have semantic HTML tags wrapping elements like <code>&ltsection&gt</code> and <code>&ltarticle&gt</code> should support reader mode.</p>

	<h3 id=why-no-framework><a href=#why-no-framework>Why I am not using a "framework"</a></h3>
	<date>April 2023</date>


	<p>These days, everyone (who isn't using Wordpress) is using Jekyll, Hugo or some kind of markdown-based blog generator.</p>

	<p>Many devs would spend days building out a blog framework and have their first blog entry about the blog framework and then.. almost no other entries for 3 months?</p>

	<p>So I am here instead writing a blog in plain HTML/CSS/JS (very, very little JS; inspect element and see), with the first entry being about why I don't have a framework then maybe no other entries for another 3 months. Who knows.</p>

	<p>Frameworks add abstraction to manual controls. The "source of truth", at the end of the day, is what's sent from the server to your browser. The built HTML code. Often with 500 different javascript libraries and CSS map files, in the case of big frontend frameworks. They come with abstracted ways to do very straight forward things that HTML allows you to do, even just for including an image.</p>

	<p>Writing plain HTML, I can control absolutely every last element without being "hacky" to bypass those "features".</p>

	<p>But when it comes to blogs, the presentation matters way less than the content - the fact that when you load a website nowadays and 90% of it is actually Javascript dependencies and boiletplated crap and only 10% is the actual content is messed up.</p>

	<p>We have insanely fast computers and phones nowadays with a massive amount of computing power. We can do so much with it - yet we are stuck loading websites that take more than 5000 milliseconds because we don't care about our footprint. We don't care about the final impact, the actual code that will be transferred across submarine cables from North Virginia to thousands of locations across the world, millions of times a day.</p>

	<p>That's why I am handwriting my website. I can run <code>wc index.html</code> on my page and it will be less than a 50MB bundle of npm packages.</p>
